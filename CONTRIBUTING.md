## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [subversivo58@gmail.com](mailto:subversivo58@gmail.com?subject=CONDUCT).


## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Initially we recommend that you [search](https://github.com/subversivo58/subversivo58.github.io/issues) for similar issues that may have already been resolved, case no, open new [issue](https://github.com/subversivo58/subversivo58.github.io/issues/new).

The following criteria are considered as good pillars for a good question:

* Describe your question with a clear and direct title

* Add relevant information such as: your system, architecture, browser, font versions, package manager, engine, etc.

* If possible add gifs, images or code blocks that reproduce the problem

* When receiving relevant help on underlying comments avoid populate comments like **+1**... instead use the reaction button on the top right side of the comment to demonstrate how relevant or helpful it is :+1:


### Suggesting Enhancements

Consider using a **[FEATURE]** prefix in the title of your question followed by a set of words that in themselves are self-explanatory.

* Describe your question with a clear and direct title

* If this feature is intended for a specific scope, add relevant information such as: your system, architecture, browser, font versions, package manager, engine, etc.

* If possible add gifs, images or code blocks that explanation this feature

* If necessary and if possible add a template to the documentation

**Note:** This repository is not intended for discussions or theoretical engagements... consider requesting an invitation to our group in [Slack](https://projectopen.slack.com/) for more detailed discussions about the request for new features.


### Your First Code Contribution

You can start your contributions to this design in the following ways:

* Adding it to your favorites list or posting to this repository

* Opening new questions to point out mistakes and if possible their solutions

* Voluntarily contribute to solve open questions

* Voluntarily traduction **wiki** or documentation

* Forking and submit your change in new pull request


### Pull Requests

Avoid sending requests to the **master** branch... unless explicitly agreed upon, requests to the **master** branch are denied immediately.

Consider following these simple rules:

* Avoid creating unnecessary segmentation

* If your request is an implementation consider creating a branch with the name of your feature

* Consider initially explaining your request to the community... look above [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)

* If you believe the above items are satisfied, please submit your pull request



## Contributors

The [list of contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md) is sorted alphabetically and must follow the following rules:

* Name of contributor with link to your repository in GitHub or to your domain or email address (a link only)

* One or more list items that describe your contribution(s) with or without a suffix that links your pull request or solved issue

The following example references this template:

```
* **[Subversivo58](https://github.com/subversivo58)**

  * Author and maintainer
  * Most features develpopment

* **[User 001](https://github.com/fake-user-001)**

  * Deeper default object inspection

* **[User 002](https://github.com/fake-user-002)**

  * Minimal test reporter
  * Timeout to ensure flushing of console output [002](fake-issue-or-pull-request-id)
```
