# [Subversivo58 Blog](https://subversivo58.github.io)

Blog news, projects, tech, tendences and cybercultures

Welcome, this is the source code of my personal blog hosted on the GitHub Page service.


## Motivation:

This repository was created to evade the standardization of CMS's for static pages


## Features:

Although hosted in a static page service I use a lot of JavaScript here to bring dynamism to the navigation interface.

A blockchain implementation (in development) is used over WebRTC data channels to create a distributed database.


## To do:

Many things to do ... a listing will be created later


## Contributing:

Your contribution to this code will be welcomed, please see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)


## Thanks:

This work is only possible thanks to the use of numerous open source libraries
