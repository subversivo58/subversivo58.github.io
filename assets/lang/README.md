## Notes

1. Portuguese Language is regimented by the treaty **"[Community of Portuguese Language Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Portuguese_Language_Countries)"** but, outside the treaty of unification of the language, the use and pronouncements are really different. If you are interested in knowing the unification agreement of this language, consult the official website [www.cplp.org/](https://www.cplp.org/)

Other languages used as a common language in several countries may present a distinction such as those presented in the item above, supporting one or other "typical" languages is a matter of subjective think ... the one with a higher (more spoken) scope is prioritized.
