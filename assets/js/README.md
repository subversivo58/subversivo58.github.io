## Directory of scripts


**files:**

* **framework.js**: this is the main script, handles the rendering of `HTML` fragments,  check requeriments of browser support (JavaScript API's required) exports functions and utility tools to `main.js` and more
* **main.js**: specific functions to adjust layout, manager routes and more

Other (third-party) scripts may appear in this directory because they contain modifications necessary to the operation of this software, and because their public versions (hyperlinks, CDN's) are incompatible with this execution.

These (third-party) scripts may (usually) contain their own licensing, commonly visible at the top of the document or above their inline if they are attached to the main script.
