## Directory of scripts


**files:**

* **prequel.js**

Other (third-party) scripts may appear in this directory because they contain modifications necessary to the operation of this software, and because their public versions (hyperlinks, CDN's) are incompatible with this execution.

These (third-party) scripts may (usually) contain their own licensing, commonly visible at the top of the document or above their inline if they are attached to the main script.
